# Tasks manager
This is a test application I was asked to do in order to have the chance to work in a company.
It mainly consists of three parts: auth (login), local tasks, and APIs tasks.
The tasks may be: inserted, updated, or deleted.
As it is a part of a test, I have not cared much about the UI. It is just a simple app get the job done.
Moreover, I skipped all the identical parts of code.
